# Trie-Trees-and-Trie-Traversals
I use an amalgamation of classes, objects, and texts to create a trie class (i.e., prefix tree) which stores words within a text based on prefixes and provides easy searching and returning capabilities for precise words with minimized time complexity. For the code below, any uploaded text can be traversed to determine the presence of a prefix, word, or the number of recurrences of a word.
